                <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                <p>Crafting a distinctive brand and web presence from ground-up for a novel venue launching in Denver.</p>
            </div>

        <!--My Role-->

            <div class="caseCard">
                <h4>My Role</h4>
                <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                <p>As the sole web designer on the project, I worked closely with the two business owners to establish their brand according to their unique vision.</p>
            </div>

        <!--Scope-->
            <div class="caseCard">
                <h4>Scope</h4>
                <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                <p>Because of an unexpected oppurtunity, the timeline to deliver a fully functional events venue website and develop a brand was 2 weeks.</p>
            </div>
            
        <!--Methodology-->
            <div class="projectCasecard">
                <div class="projectCaseinfo">
                    <h4>Methodology</h4>
                    <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                    <p>Because of the expedited timeline I quickly got together with the stakeholders to develop and strategize our approach. We came up with a list of deliverables based on the methodology of empathize, define, brainstorm, prototype, test.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <h4>Interviews & Research</h4>
                <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                <p>In order to align the vision between myself and the two owners, I interviewed them together. Asking open-ended questions about the mission and personality of the brand lead to some important insights, and helped align the two owners on a common vision. During this time we analyzed over 20 websites for venues from Denver's Marquis Theater to The Bellweather in Los Angeles. Given the timeframe, I suggested we build our website on a website builder application with customizable CMS to fit the unique needs of the platform. We settled on Wix after considering Wordpress, React, and Shopify as potential platforms. Ticketing for events needed to be able to be linked to all manner of third party ticketing vendors since Creepatorium rents itself out as an events venue as well hosting its own shows. Designing a simple template for events to be managed through Wix's customizable CMS feature fit the needs of both the owner, event coordinator, and outside producers. </p>

                    <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                    <p>We took the time to define what Creepatorium needed delivered for a successful branding and web presence.</p>
                    <h3>1.</h3>
                    <p>An eye catching and interesting logo inspired by 90's horror, Goosebumps books, and the circus.</p>
                    <h3>2.</h3>
                    <p>A simple to use and easy to navigate website with custom CMS for displaying events, an about section, and means to contact the venue for information and bookings.</p>
                    <h3>3.</h3>
                    <p>A leading and user friendly web design platform for non-technical stakeholders to maintain.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h4><b>Branding & Style</b></h4>
                    <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                    <p>Inspired by 90's horror, circus, and burlesque, Creepatorium's logo was designed and developed with constant guidance from the owners, from the custom lettering to the big top circus tent topper. We iterated several versions of the design until our final draft was ready to be vectored and finalized, ready to be shared with Denver's alternative eventgoers. It was during this time we came up with the tagline "An alternative venue for weirdos, by weirdos." It was important to the owners that our community understood that this space is an inclusive space for everyone.</p>

                <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                <p>With our problem defined and a path towards a solution, we started brainstorming ideas using the Mind Map method, as well as sorting our user's insights by their impactfulness and feasability on a feature prioritization matrix. We asked ourselves the question over and over again:</p>
                <h3>How do we make AI more user friendly?</h3>

                <h4><b>Rapid Prototyping</b></h4>
                <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                <p>The Prototyping phase began with a simple hand sketched wireframe. Some inital ideas about how to display features and options, such as the accessibility sidebar, began their journey here, to be iterated and tested upon throughout prototyping.</p>
                <div class="caseContainer">
                    <div class="caseCard">

                        <h4>Sketch</h4>
                        <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                        <p>Our original sketch featured a simple input button, the accessibility sidebar, and an example of an AI response with a voice indicator, more options button, and an icon indicating the response came from the AI.</p>
                    </div>

                        <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                        <p>Another early wireframe prototype featured a friendier idea of an AI home page, with prompt suggestions. The primary CTA uses the term "Dialogue" which our users agreed was friendlier than "Exchange" or "Interaction".</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="caseCard">

                        <div class="caseLinebreak"></div>
                        <p>Bringing a friendly companion into the application was a hit with our users! We also replaced the "New Dialogue" button with a multimodal toolbar, which our users found useful while interacting via multiple input modes.</p>

                <p>All in all, we tested our final prototype with 6 people, and rated the ease with which they completed two tasks. Our users were successful on both tasks around 80% of the time. While the success rate was high, we saw users face challenges with contextual assistance and recognizing the next step to take.</p>

                <p>In the final mobile prototype for SundropAI, we sought to build a useful, accessible artificial intelligence application for everyone. We looked back constantly on our initial research, as well as testing new features and paths as we prototyped. We focused on a user story in which a busy working mother is interested in discovering how AI might help her with an everyday task: grocery shopping.</p>
